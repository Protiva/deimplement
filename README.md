## Why We Need a Resource Repository for De-Implementation
The continued use of low-value clinical practices diminishes the quality of healthcare that patients receive and exacerbates healthcare costs.[1] Low-value practices are collectively referred to as care that provides little or no benefit, is costly, or potentially harmful. The delivery of low-value services varies substantially across healthcare organizations, but even the highest-performing organizations frequently use low-value practices.[2] Although there are increasing investments in work to accelerate the translation of evidence-based practices into real-world settings, less attention has been paid to efforts to de-implement low-value care.[3,4]

The use of low-value cancer screening represents not only healthcare waste but also a potential cascade of invasive diagnostic procedures and significant patient anxiety and distress. Khan et al. demonstrated that it takes an average of 15 years from the publication of a landmark study for cancer-related interventions to achieve 50% uptake in practice;[5] however, little remains known about the time it takes to de-implement low-value cancer control practices. 

A key contributing factor to the dearth of information regarding de-implementation of low value cancer screening practices is the lack of a centralized infrastructure to document and keep track of strides in de-implementation. This webpage is a primary step towards mitigating the fragmentation of de-implementation resources and surveillance.

This repository serves as a centralized hub for information related to tracking de-implementation of low-value cancer screening practices. Our goal for this webpage is for it to serve as a centralized and collaborative space for researchers, clinicians, and learning health systems to find and share the latest updates, issues, and breakthroughs regarding de-implementation. Given no such collaborative space currently exists in the area of de-implementation, this repository will allow people working in the space of de-implementation to stay up to date on the latest advancements in the field, but also to easily share their own resources with the community.
